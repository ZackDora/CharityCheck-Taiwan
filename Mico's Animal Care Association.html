            <p>Aims to provide proper care for homeless cats and help them find permanent homes. In addition to caring for cats at the shelter, the organization also rescues animals from shelters to increase their visibility and chances of adoption.</p>
            <p>The association has taken in nearly a hundred stray cats, including those that are old, sick, or disabled. They provide regular veterinary check-ups, vaccinations, medical care, and nutrition. Despite the high costs associated with caring for long-term residents , Mico's has successfully facilitated the adoption of nearly a thousand cats since 2017, thanks to a strict and reliable adoption process that minimizes returns.</p>

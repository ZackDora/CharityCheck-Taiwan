        <p class="margin">We are a group of four students from the Department of Foreign Languages at NCHU, currently enrolled in the English Business course as of October 2024. Our first group project focused on the theme of 'Charity,' which inspired the creation of this website.</p>

                <h2>Idea's Background</h2>
                <p class="">Many people, when they think of doing charity, will think of donating to or collaborating with charitable organizations. As people want their contributions to be used effectively, the credibility of these organizations has always been one of the most crucial factors.</p>
                <p>In Taiwan, there are many charitable organizations, which include various types, ranging from purely charitable and business-related charity to religious charity. The landscape is, in a positive sense, diverse, but from a more critical or negative perspective, it can be seen as chaotic and filled with uncertainties.</p>
                <p>Our group wants to do one simple thing: collect information about as many charitable organizations in Taiwan as possible. After gathering this information, we will present it more clearly and analyze it so that people can make more informed choices when selecting a charitable organization.

            <h2 class="margin-for-text">Evaluation Method</h2>
            <ul>
                <li>Minus 1 if there are no records/reports about the activities</li>
                <li>Minus 1 for each if the quantity and the quality of the reports are not sufficient</li>
                <ul>
                    <li>Lack in Quantity: the reports do not have detailed invoices, the amount of money raised (and the related information like personal information of the donator, the time the donation was made, and how the donation was used), and information related to the activities that were held (Planning, activity results, and after-activity evaluation and discussion). If other relevant information is not included, one minus point will still be deducted.</li>
                    <li>Lack in Quality: The newest report is more than two years old or the reports do not meet the requirements of a legal document (for example, lack of signatures). The content of reports does not demonstrate clearly how the activities were planned, held, and evaluated, how the donated money was used, and other information were stated but have no backing evidences. The images or videos (if included) are not clear (the preferred quality is HD and above)</li>
                </ul>
                <li>Minus 1 if there are no records/reports specifically about how the money is used overall and for each specific activity was held. This minus point, though does have some similarities with the minus point in quality and quantity of the reports, is deducted independently.</li>
                <li>Minus 1 if there are no social networks or websites</li>
                <li>Minus 1 if the websites or social networks are not active (there are no new updates or worthy updates)</li>
                <li>Minus 1 if the websites are hard to navigate (poor organization, poor typography, lagging, blank webpages, and more)</li>
                <li>Minus 1 if there are no annual charitable activities</li>
                <li>Minus 1 if the organization has too many different types of activities and they are not paying attention to all of them equally</li>
                <li>Minus 5 if there are any scandals</li>
            </ul>
